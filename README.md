# Cook It!
IS 385 This is a repository for the IS 385 project completed by Joji Maldonado, 
Jose Cruz, John Nguyen, Hoan Nguyen, Victor Le, and Felix Huang. The goal of this project was to 
brainstorm and design an application that could be used to solve an existing problem. 
Documentation for the planning of this project will also be included in this repository.

## Project Description
View the project prompt [here](https://github.com/felixthe8/Cook-It/blob/master/Project%20Description%20Fall%202018.pdf)  
Cook It! attempts to help people answer the question of "what should we eat tonight?". Through our research, our group 
found that the number of households who eat and cook at home has decreased dramatically over the last decade. Eating out also 
incurs a larger financial cost, as compared to cooking meals at home. When we eat out, we also have less control of what goes into our food. Cook It! aims to solve these problems by allowing users to pick up ingredients for a meal they can cook themselves at a local grocery store of their choosing. After picking up the meal, Cook It! users can view recipe instructions on how to cook the meal as well as any food allergens that the meal may contain.
