            Cook It! was founded in 2018 on one principle - getting people back into cooking. 
            It is this principle that has driven all the features and services that Cook It! offers. 
            Cook It! lets you pick the meal that you to cook want, without you having to go to the store yourself to 
            pick up the ingredients. Instead, Cook It! coordinates with the store for you. For each meal you order, we will also show you the ingredients
            and nutrition facts because we truly believe that the best version of you is the one that
            knows what's going into your body. Cook It! is perfect for all occassions - a romantic night in,
            a quick meet-up with an old friend, and a fantastic meal that hits the spot after a long day.
            Create an account, download the Cook It! app, and get started today.
